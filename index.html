                          Hey all,

It was really great hearing from everyone who replied. Again I hope you all are doing well and I can't wait to catch up when I get back. It's been a long couple of days, but I've finally had the chance to sit down and send a proper email.

As far as the adventure goes, after Ha Long Bay, we took a four hour bus ride back to Hanoi where we prepared for our overnight train ride to Hue, pronounced hwhey. We were exhausted and this was primarily a sleep/travel day. On the train we were provided bunk beds and shared our car with a middle aged couple from Holland. They were super nice and a true testament to the fact that Southeast Asia isn't only a young person's region. 

But at last we reached Hue, a sort of beach town - backpacker hang out city. Our walk from the train station to the hotel area was beside a river covered in grass and parks on both sides. Every park had unique and rustic sculptures all showing decades of wear and tear and in between were stands selling disposable cameras and film. We started our day by checking into our hotel and heading out to the Imperial Enclosure.

The Imperial Enclosure is essentially a gated village where Vietnamese dynasty's and officials used to reside. The area was a massive city full of historical buildings and temples, each having some significance to different dynasties. Unfortunately most of the city was destroyed in the Vietnam.. or as they call it here, the American war. As you approach the city, you see an area with several American and Vietnamese fighter jets, a gigantic moat surrounding entrance gates.

The city was beautiful and from what I understand restoration efforts have been going on for decades to get it close to its historical state. None the less, a lot of it is standing and it was great (although a bit boring without proper context) walking around. At points I got an eerie feeling seeing half destroyed/ decomposing architecture throughout the city. There are a lot of just empty buildings with no apparent function or purpose, yet construction is everywhere. One area that especially stood out was a set of about twenty stairs climbing up a hill beside a beautiful tree that I suppose survived it all. It overlooked gardens once enjoyed by Vietnamese dynasties and other inhabitants of the city. Lying down for a couple of minutes on a ledge atop this hill was by far one of the most relaxing parts of the trip.

Aside from the citadel, there was little to do in the city. We stayed in a heavily populated backpacker area with a couple of cool bars. We met some interesting people there with crazy backgrounds and stories. For instance one was a freelance writer from England who was traveling and looking for work at one of the Local hostels. Another was a guy from Manhattan wearing a shirt that said "you had me at shalom," the first and only Jew and one of the few Americans that we had met along the way. We proceeded to exchange travel stories and tips with a bunch of backpackers over some beers. We even went 3 for 3 in pool, but then again would you expect anything less from the 2014 pi kapp beirut champions? (We won on scratched eight balls every single game).

The following day we woke up at 9am and embarked on a teeth clenching, knuckle whitening, absolutely insane eight hour motorbike trip to Hoi An. We were given a map, two helmets, and a three second tutorial on how to start and accelerate the bike. And just like that we were prepared to join the thousands of other bikers, bicyclists.. and truck and bus drivers on the road. I began the trip having never ridden in my life - it was terrifying. We started our trip just getting out of the city. As I rode, although not completely, I gradually became desensitized to the terrain. It started off as the city, then the roads narrowed as we passed through different villages. These narrow roads quickly became roads covered in potholes, and eventually just turned into dirt. Every change made you miss the last. Despite this it kept the ride interesting.. as if it wasn't already :) . Furthermore we had the freedom to go at our own pace and take each new setting as it came.

The majority of the ride was through villages with modest homes and farms lining the road. Along the way we passed children and teenagers getting out of school and walking home. They were all incredibly cheerful and eager to practice their English, many calling out "helloooo" and waiving, and even one who happily shouted out an enthusiastic "fuck you!" Many wore matching track suits, I guess indicative of a dress code.. or maybe they just run track. Regardless it was cool getting a look into the lives of these kids not too far away in age from me. And most importantly they all seemed happy, and visibly joked around with and played games with their friends just like all of us.

Along the way you really see how these people live. It seems as though everyone is constantly doing work either on their homes or other buildings. Yet one thing you quickly notice is how run down everything is. I really started to wonder how long these people have been doing this work, if they would ever reach a point where their homes were in a decent condition, and finally if their homes were ever in a good condition to begin with. You see a lot of elderly people sitting outside their homes  and many knee-deep in water farming in the rice fields that cover the country side. It was a powerful feeling considering how these people lived day to day and what my situation would be like if I were in their shoes.. I know very cliche, but unbelievably true.

I later heard a guide at the Ho Chi Minh independence hall explain what was happening there. He explained how things haven't changed much in the past 50 years for these people. He explained how they would all lose their job if any machinery whatsoever were introduced. That the people send their children to school in hopes of getting them an education and out of the area. These kids eventually go off to study in Saigon or other parts of the world, effectively leaving those that still live in the country uneducated.

But anyway, along the way we stopped off at a place called Sa Voi. The road that led there seemed ancient. There was a massive Buddhist temple on the side that we stopped off at on the way. The temple was on the side of a mountain with hundreds stone stairs leading higher and higher up a path lined with statues and other mini temples.

The real Sa Voi came a bit further down the road. Sa Voi is a rocky stream that runs down the mountain with crude huts built on both sides. The huts were nothing more than a frame made of branches covered in blue tarps. In the the center of the stream there is a gigantic elephant statue. Like the imperial enclosure, it was a fantastic place to take a break and take in and consider another way that people live.

We left Sa Voi and continued our ride. The following road was covered in oversized trucks and buses. It was really miserable driving with them, but there were enough fellow motorbikers on the road to confirm that we weren't in fact crazy. This difficult road was followed by Da Nang mountain pass which made it all worth it. The road zig zagged up the mountain giving us breath taking views, each more beautiful than the last.

And finally we reached Da Nang, an industrial city twenty miles outside of Hoi An. The road was finally relatively empty and it was amazing going 60km/hr (sounds a lot faster than ~35 miles/hr) with wind hitting you in the face as you drove over the massive bridge and past the gorgeous beaches just outside of Hoi An. 

And finally we arrived at our destination, Hoi An.. exhausted, sunburned, but with a feeling of accomplishment. I couldn't see myself going the entire way down Vietnam, but what an absolutely amazing trip.

Hoi An. Many backpackers we met along the way said that Hoi An was their favorite part of Vietnam, and I could finally see why. I personally found it incredibly nostalgic, bringing up memories of summers in East Brunswick as a kid. The first night we stayed in a backpacker dorm totally away from everything that makes Hoi An in anyway unique or special. Despite this, we still had a great night getting to know the other backpackers we were staying with; an English girl, a guy from Scotland, and two more from Netherlands.

The second day we were there, we were displaced from our hotel and forced to find another. The one we moved to was located in the "old town" and was an exponentially better location. Old town is reminiscent of Hanoi as far as shops, but much cleaner, brighter, and for the most part relaxed. There are shops and Chinese temples everywhere. All of this is beside a beautiful river filled with docked boats and ornate bridges. The other side of this bridge is a community filled with bars, restaurants, and bike rentals. I would say a major highlight was just renting a bike and cruising around the city.

Now if there is one thing Hoi An is known for, it's its tailors. Hundreds of tailor shops cover the roads, all looking to custom make any suit, shirt, or pair of shoes you want. Satish got a tailored white dress shirt, I went the shoe route. As we were walking, a pair of Adidas sneakers caught my eye. Upon further inspection, I realized that the women at the shop sewed on three stripes, painted the trefoil logo on the tongue, and put them all on top of DC (skateboard shoes) brand soles. They advertised that they could "make any brand," and I couldn't resist pimping out my boat shoes with the Nike swoosh.

But more significant is Hoi An's cultural and historical preservation. Hoi An was heavily influenced by Chinese and Japanese culture. With that there are amazing temples to be seen during the day and pretty funny soap opera esque public shows at night.

The second day we picked up our tailor made stuff and headed to the beach. It was about a mile from old town with resorts going up and down the coast. We rented bicycles again and made the trip, along way stopping to watch farmers and other people live their lives. On our way back we stopped at a park. As we road in we saw a group of teenagers breakdancing. There were some incredible b-boys and we watched for as long as we could before we were compelled to join in as well. One of the kids taught us some moves and told us a little about growing up in Hoi An which was really awesome to hear about.


We ended the day with some Hoi An street food, and putting those candle-boat things into the river. 


All in all Hoi An was one of my favorite places in Vietnam. The lifestyle and things we saw were so familiar, but at the same time so different. It is a place where no cash registers exist, but instead the waitress pulls out a wad of bills and asks if you have change for a twenty. It's a place where people ride around with megaphones attached to their motorcycles blaring what sounds like police announcements, until you find out that they're really just trying to sell bread. And most importantly? it's a place where beer that costs more than 20 cents is considered a ripoff. 

At last we said goodbye to Hoi An and grabbed an hour flight to Ho Chi Minh. We arrived at midnight and took a cab into the city. We were taken to the street where our hotel was supposed be. We were on the correct street but the number of the address read 41/33. It took us a while to figure out that this meant number 33 down a sketchy looking narrow alley. Your opinion quickly changes.. slightly.. as you walk down and see the life, the restaurants, and guest houses on this four foot wide road. We rang the bell of one of the recommended guest houses and a short Vietnamese man greeted us at the gates door. He invited us in, gave us a quick overview of the city, and showed us to our room where explained how to use the lights, tv, wifi, shower, sink, outlets, and toilet. He was a really kind guy though and he lives and manages the guesthouse with his wife and kids. It's the type of place where you have to take your shoes off before entering the house. And at the door you see about ten pairs belonging to fellow backpackers.

We started the next day (today) by grabbing breakfast and heading to the War Remnants Museum. The museum was a pretty difficult one to get through. The entire museum put the United States in an awful light making me feel almost like I imagine a German would going through Holocaust museum. It was a side of the story, although I couldn't tell if it was biased, that was rarely if ever told in America. I was happy however to see that they touched on American protests against the war. 

You begin by going through a room showing the brutality of American soldiers on civilians. The room is full of hard to look at pictures and diagrams showing death and injury counts. This didn't even compare to the next room that explained the use of agent orange and other chemicals, and the disastrous results on victims, victims' children, and even American veterans. Despite all of this, I found a couple of the acts of courage and kindness demonstrated by American soldiers to be beautiful. There was a display of two American pilots who saved dozens of Vietnamese civilians. And an American medic who was severely injured but still helped comrades in worse condition. Overall it was a very powerful museum, and interesting to observe so many tourists of different origins view the exhibits.

Next we went to independence hall. A gigantic building with beautiful architecture full of historical meeting rooms. It was cool walking around this and seeing pictures of past presidents discussing our countries' relationship.

We ended the day by visiting a massive indoor market. The first thing you see is a stand selling different varieties of coffees and coffee makers, another selling t shirts, and another selling sneakers. Then you see hundreds of these, all identical in products, and you know with 100% certainty that the Vans, Adidas, and New Balance are all fake. You walk through and can't make eye contact with anyone without being asked to buy something. You see a lot of desperation and after fifteen minutes of being grabbed by the shoulder at every booth booth, and saying you're not interested in buying, you just want to get out of there. So much so that you're willing to buy a water just to grab a seat on the sidewalk and get a couple of minutes to breath.

So as you could probably tell, this was one of the more solemn days, but none the less thought provoking and moving.

We went back to the hotel to relax for a bit and then headed out to check out the Ho Chi Minh night life. Like Hanoi, the streets were covered in tiny plastic chairs and tables with hundreds of people drinking with their friends.. on a Sunday. Hundreds of locals walked up and down the street trying to sell things. I actually lost my lonely planet book today, and was able to pick up a copy.. a entirely photocopied copy. We capped off the night with some McDonalds and are finally back to the hotel. Tomorrow we go to the art museum, and head off to Cambodia.

So that's been the last couple of days. I'm sorry for the novel, but again our days have been so packed. We've been having a blast, and I've been learning so much about this country and the different ways that people live. Just to reiterate, we've been staying safe and responsible and we'll be sure to keep it up.

I hope you are all doing well! 

All the best,
Mark
