                        <p>
                        This is at the end of a long list of personal-websites I have aspired to create in my adult life. College to post grad life. When I was nine, I tried to build a website just for the sake of having/building a website. I checked out web development books from the library and read none of them. I had no content in mind. I was just trying to make something because the thought of putting a part of yourself online was an amazing idea. Then there was a shift. I had some content in mind, but little experience. None the less I deployed several, gracing the likes of angelfire, tripod, and geocities.
                            
                        <p>And now, equiped with a degree in computer science engineering, I find myself in college to post grad life (for the rest of my life). Having content and experience, yet having not released a thing. This is the first real website I've pushed out in nearly ten years, and it feels.. great!
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        For this one, I chose <strike>to be 
 boring</strike> to take some (one) websites that I admired and make them my own. To not feel the pressure of starting from scratch, forcing myself to learn a new technology, or coming up with a groundbreaking user interface design. This time I challenged myself to deliver anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I stumbled upon <a class="article-link" href="http://www.lampemm.com">lampemm</a> a couple of months ago, and loved the simplicity of their layout. I borrowed tremendously from them (so give them a visit), and all in all, this was the way to go. To let design follow content. This is the first personal website where writing the UI was straightforward, and where I actually took the time to write an (this) &quot;article&quot;.

                        <p>
                        So this.. is.. it... my website. A place serving as a showcase for my various projects, and of course, my ingenious musings (this is going to be a &quot;high-brow&quot; sort of place).
