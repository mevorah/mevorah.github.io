Last year I graduated from the University of Michigan, moved to Seattle, and have been working at a popular book store ever since. Hi, my name is Mark. 

A serious personal website is something I have wanted to create for some time now. I've had numerous attempts and yet have consistently fallen short due to the inherent work that comes from writing a well thought out article (if I do say so myself), and the pressure of applying my degreen in computer science engineering to create the most technologically advanced personal webisite.. ever.
                        
No, this time I chose <strike>to be boring</strike> to take some (one) websites that I admired and make them my own. To not feel the pressure of starting from scratch, forcing myself to learn a new technology, or coming up with a groundbreaking user interface design. This time I challenged myself to deliver anything.

I stumbled upon <a class="article-link" href="http://www.lampemm.com">lampemm</a> a couple of months ago, and loved the simplicity of their layout. I borrowed tremendously from them (so give them a visit), and all in all, this was the way to go. To let design follow content. This is the first personal website where writing the UI was straightforward, and where I actually took the time to write an (this) &quot;article&quot;.

So this.. is.. it... my website. A place serving as a showcase for my various projects, and of course, my ingenious musings (this is going to be a &quot;high-brow&quot; sort of place).
