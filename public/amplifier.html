                <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>
                The idea for the amp came when looking at my practice amp that I've been using since I started playing guitar twelve years ago. It's red, has plastic protective corners, boasts the logo "Mega Amp" - it looks cheap (and it was). Moreover, it has the same style as pretty much all amps. Sort of a hard, foamy, foux leather exterierior surrounding a speaker behind some black mesh - you know, that "classic" amplifier look.

                It occured to me that there are few amps out there that break this trend. And of those amps that do, none opt for a modern/minimalist design.
                </p>
                <p>
                With that, I set out to design and build a new exterior for a practice combo amp. It would be grey, 3D printed, and would be directed toward me, the user, sitting down on the couch, in a studio apartment, playing guitar.
                </p>
                <p>
                About a year had passed and I found myself <strike>wanting</strike> needing a fulfilling side project to work on outside of work. The grey amp came to mind. My goal, to build an extremely usable and modern amplifier that would serve as a piece of furnature in one's apartment.

                I found <a class="article-link" href="http://www.lampemm.com">lampemm</a>, and immediately ditched grey plastic for walnut. The rest followed: 
                </p>
                <h1>On Paper</h1>
                <p>
                It's hard to articulate how I started. I had a vision in my head of what the finished product would look like. It's a weird feeling, holding such a high level of conviction that the vision in your head is entirely planned out and that the design aspect is just a matter of transfering that image to paper. It's not until I began this process, that I discovered the massive holes. That this original idea was nothing more than seeing an object at a single angle out of the corner of your eye. You could dicern the broad brushstrokes, but 99% had yet to be designed/determined. The rest of the angles had yet to be seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                As I drew, I continuously revealled missing pieces. Pieces of the product that I hadn't considered. Thus began the continous cycle of uncovering gaps (and thus more work) in my original idea, feeling defeated, and having to get over the wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                This was the first industrial design project I took on. I never knew how much thought was involved in designing a product. That every question could have multiple answers and through an imprecise science, it is one's job to determine which decision is correct, which looks the best. The independednt decisions made for every side of the amplifier culmunating into a finished produt.
                </p>
                <p>
                And with that, I hope to capture, the still ongoing process of bringing this amplifier to its final state, remensicient of the image I cought out of the corner of my eye back in September 2015.
