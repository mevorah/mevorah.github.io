**Hello!** If you've been here before, you'll have noticed some changes. After a ~year of inactivity, I have returned to make this site a proper blog where I can post about what's going on!

We'll see what this develops into. As of writing this, I've been cooking non-stop (see Cook-90 challenge), training for a half marathon in February, and working a lot at my job in the emerging devices org at Amazon. I'd love for this site to turn into a sort of public journal where I can talk about all or none of the things I just mentioned.

But we'll see. Until then, I'll be out on a run üèÉ
