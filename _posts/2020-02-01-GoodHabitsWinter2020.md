When I entered adulthood, I entered a phase in my life full of repetition. I set an alarm, woke up, made coffee, and went to work - my first routine, if you could call it that; it was short and work focused. As months passed in that first role, I had grown increasingly dissatisfied with my job. I began giving myself things to look forward to (rather, things to get me out of bed) the next morning. And was born, my morning routine! It started with coffee, breakfast, and an episode of TV (Cheers). <!--more-->It took 1hr 10minutes. 

Since its inception, I’ve experienced my share of ups and downs professionally and personally. I’ve learned that the aspects of my life demanding the most attention should be done regularly, and in the morning. Since then, my morning routine has grown to serve a variety of purposes, and now spans 3-4 hours (I am also, now, a morning person). I realize this commitment is not affordable to everyone, but yet I couldn’t imagine life without it. This series is dedicated to my love of routine, or what I often refer to as “good habits”.

..perhaps this will inspire the next generation of _morning_ people!

So without further ado, every day I...
1. 6:30 wake up naturally (without alarm) to get a full 8hours of sleep (See Why We Sleep)
1. 6:34 start playing Up First to stay current with the news of the day
1. 6:35 begin boiling water/ grind coffee (26g) to be able to get other things done in parallel
1. 6:37 open the shades to greet the day
1. 6:40 go to the bathroom to pee
1. 6:42 make my bed to greet me later and to resemble a a gentle beige horizon that I can begin/ end my meditation looking at < stares off wistfully >

### Learnings and tips
1. Matthew Walker of Why We Sleep says humans have evolved to be morning people and night people. I am a morning person - it is the time when I’m most focused. Anything that you want to do that requires mental focus should be reserved for the time of day where you’re at your best.
2. Not all items in my routine are created equal. Keep the absolute essentials at the beginning, and move things that can be reduced or dropped toward the end - when you’re late to work, you can at the very least get the bare minimum in.
3. Find the activities that make you look forward to waking up
4. A morning routine that provides adequate me-time reduces/ removes resentment for work no matter how much you like your job.
