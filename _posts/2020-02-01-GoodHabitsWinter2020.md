When I entered adulthood, I entered a phase in my life full of repetition. I set an alarm, woke up, made coffee, and went to work - my first routine.. if you could call it that \*\*chuckles to himself\*\*; it was short and getting-to-work focused. As months passed in that first role, I longed for something more exciting. In the interim, I began giving myself things to look forward to the next morning. And was born, my morning routine! It started with coffee, breakfast, <!--more-->and an episode of TV ([Cheers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers)). It took 1hr 10minutes. 

Since its inception, I’ve experienced my share of ups and downs both professionally and personally. I’ve learned that the aspects of my life demanding the most attention should be done regularly, and in the morning. Since then, my morning routine has grown to serve a variety of purposes, and now spans 3-4 hours (I am also, now, a morning person). I realize this commitment is not affordable to everyone, but yet I couldn’t imagine life without it. This series is dedicated to my love of routine, or what I often refer to as “my good habits”.

..perhaps this will inspire the next generation of _morning_ people!

So without further ado, every day I...

### Learnings and tips
3. Find the activities that make you look forward to waking up
1. Matthew Walker, author of Why We Sleep, explains that humans have evolved to be morning people and night people. I am a morning person - it is the time when I am most focused. Anything that you want to do that requires mental focus should be reserved for the time of day where you’re at your best.
2. Not all items in my routine are created equal. Keep the absolute essentials at the beginning, and move things that can be reduced or dropped towards the end - when you’re late, you can get the bare minimum in.
4. A morning routine that provides adequate me-time reduces/ removes resentment for work no matter how much you like your job.
